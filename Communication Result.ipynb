    "\n",
    "- **Model Popularity**: Sedans and SUVs are the most popular car body types, with Ford, Chevrolet, Nissan, Toyota, and Dodge being the top brands. And the top 5 model are Nissan Altima, Ford F-150, Ford Fusion, Toyota Camry and Ford Escape.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Color Preference**: Black, white, grey, and silver are the most popular car colors, both exterior and interior.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Transmission**: Automatic transmission cars have better resale value and are more popular among buyers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mileage Impact**: The more mileage a car has, the lower its sale price. Additionally, cars with a more recent manufacturing year tend to have better prices. There are some car models where the price increase slightly, the range is between 10k to 25k mileage before dropping.\n"

    "To understand price changed with mileage for the top 3 best-selling cars, we analyzed their price dynamics, focusing on the Ford F-150 due to its unique trend of initial price increased before decline. This trend was attributed to several factors making the F-150 highly demanded. After doing research, the truck was known for its reliability and durability, powerful performance with options like EcoBoost engines, and versatility with numerous configurations. Ford consistently offered a comfortable, spacious interior. The F-150 maintained a strong resale value, driven by brand loyalty and a robust dealer network. These factors, combined with effective marketing, make the Ford F-150 a popular and consistently high demanded truck in the market."

    "The project revealed several important findings regarding the purchase of used cars in the USA. The three brands that were widely sold and represented affordability, reliability, ease of maintenance, and cost-effectiveness were Ford, Chevrolet, and Nissan. These brands catered to the mass market due to their diverse range of models that suited various budgets and needs. When considering potential resale value, greyscale colors (white, black, grey, and silver) were found to be the best choices. These colors tented to be more popular and are perceived as neutral, thus appealing to a broader range of buyers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sedans and SUVs emerged as the most popular body types for used cars. Sedans were favored for their affordability, fuel efficiency, and practicality in urban settings. In contrast, SUVs were preferred for their versatility, safety, spaciousness, and capability in all-weather conditions. Market trends and lifestyle preferences played significant roles in driving the popularity of these body types. Automatic transmissions were found to dominate the market due to their user-friendly nature and convenience, eliminating the need for manual gear changes. This preference aligns with the demand for ease of use and comfort among drivers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the project indicated that vehicles with mileage exceeding 150,000 miles were deemed to have significantly reduced value, according to the price prediction model used. This highlights that mileage is a critical factor in determining the worth of a used car. These findings provide a comprehensive overview of the factors influencing purchase decisions and market trends in the used car industry in the USA.\n"
