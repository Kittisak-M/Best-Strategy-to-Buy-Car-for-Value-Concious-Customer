    "\n",
    "- **Model Popularity**: Sedans and SUVs are the most popular car body types, with Ford, Chevrolet, Nissan, Toyota, and Dodge being the top brands. And the top 5 model are Nissan Altima, Ford F-150, Ford Fusion, Toyota Camry and Ford Escape.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Color Preference**: Black, white, grey, and silver are the most popular car colors, both exterior and interior.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Transmission**: Automatic transmission cars have better resale value and are more popular among buyers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mileage Impact**: The more mileage a car has, the lower its sale price. Additionally, cars with a more recent manufacturing year tend to have better prices. There are some car models where the price increase slightly, the range is between 10k to 25k mileage before dropping.\n"

    "To understand price changed with mileage for the top 3 best-selling cars, we analyzed their price dynamics, focusing on the Ford F-150 due to its unique trend of initial price increased before decline. This trend was attributed to several factors making the F-150 highly demanded. After doing research, the truck was known for its reliability and durability, powerful performance with options like EcoBoost engines, and versatility with numerous configurations. Ford consistently offered a comfortable, spacious interior. The F-150 maintained a strong resale value, driven by brand loyalty and a robust dealer network. These factors, combined with effective marketing, make the Ford F-150 a popular and consistently high demanded truck in the market."
