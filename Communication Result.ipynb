    "To understand price changed with mileage for the top 3 best-selling cars, we analyzed their price dynamics, focusing on the Ford F-150 due to its unique trend of initial price increased before decline. This trend was attributed to several factors making the F-150 highly demanded. After doing research, the truck was known for its reliability and durability, powerful performance with options like EcoBoost engines, and versatility with numerous configurations. Ford consistently offered a comfortable, spacious interior. The F-150 maintained a strong resale value, driven by brand loyalty and a robust dealer network. These factors, combined with effective marketing, make the Ford F-150 a popular and consistently high demanded truck in the market."

    "## Recommendation\n",
    "\n",
    "When looking to purchase a used car, several factors can help guide your decision. Firstly, consider the car's color, as certain colors are more popular and tend to have better resale value. Black, white, grey, and silver are among the most sought-after colors in the used car market. Additionally, pay attention to the interior color, with black, grey, and beige being safe choices that appeal to a wide range of buyers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, the body type of the car can also impact its resale value. Sedans and SUVs are generally more popular and have higher demand compared to other body types. They also tend to hold their value better over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transmission type is another important consideration. Automatic transmissions are preferred by many buyers due to their ease of use, especially in heavy traffic. They also tend to have better resale value compared to manual transmissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, consider the brand of the car. Brands like Ford, Chevrolet, Nissan, Toyota, and Dodge are well-regarded and have a strong reputation for reliability and durability. Choosing a car from one of these brands can often result in a better resale value and lower depreciation over time.\n"
