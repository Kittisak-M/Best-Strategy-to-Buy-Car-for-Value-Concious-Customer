# Best Buys: Cars with High Resale Value and Low Depreciation üöóüìà

## Project Overview

In this project, we explore the Vehicle Sales dataset to identify the best brand-new or used cars to buy based on their potential resale value and low depreciation. The goal is to provide insights and data-driven recommendations for consumers and dealerships looking to make informed decisions when purchasing vehicles. By analyzing factors such as model popularity, mileage, car color, and age, we aim to pinpoint cars that hold their value well over time.

## Introduction

When considering the purchase of a vehicle, one of the key questions that often arises is its potential resale value. Many buyers wonder about the factors that can influence the selling price later on. Understanding these factors is crucial for making informed decisions and maximizing the value of your purchase. This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of these factors.

## Dataset üìä

The Vehicle Sales dataset includes various attributes such as year, make, model, trim, body, transmission, state, condition, odometer, color, interior, seller, MMR, selling price, and sale date. This dataset is used to perform detailed analyses and derive actionable insights.

## Data Analysis üîç

The analysis focuses on several key aspects:
- **Model Popularity**: Identifying which car models are popular and retain their value.
- **Mileage**: Analyzing how mileage affects the resale value of cars.
- **Car Color**: Investigating the impact of car color on resale value.
- **Age of Vehicle**: Understanding how the age of the vehicle correlates with its depreciation.

## Key Findings üìà

1. **Mileage Impact**: Vehicles with mileage under 10,000 tend to have a higher resale value. For example, the Ford F150 shows a stable price increase up to 30,000 miles, after which the value drops dramatically.
2. **Model Preferences**: The Nissan Altima is a great choice for higher mileage (over 15,000 miles) due to its gradual depreciation compared to other models.
3. **Color and Resale**: Certain car colors may have a significant impact on resale value, which is explored in the analysis.

## Conclusion

By understanding the factors that influence vehicle resale value, consumers can make better purchasing decisions, and dealerships can optimize their inventory. This project highlights the importance of considering mileage, model popularity, car color, and vehicle age when buying a car to ensure it retains its value over time.
